# CrimZen

A mixed color theme for Visual Studio Code. CrimZen uses a light design for the coding area with a darker style for all other regions. This design seeks to achieve a balance between the harshness of light themes and the low-contrast, washed-out bleakness of dark themes. This theme will likely look its best in rooms with high ambient lighting.

## Suggested Fonts

This theme was built and tested using the [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/), [IBM Plex Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex/releases), and [Deja Vu Sans Mono](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) fonts.

## Problems

Visual Studio Code controls the colors of a few elements, but grants access to dozens of others. I was not able to locate every single setting. In almost all of those cases, I allowed Visual Studio Code to set defaults. However, because I'm mixing light and dark theme design patterns, I expect some of those defaults might result in major legibility problems. If you find one, please report it on the theme's [issues page](https://github.com/ejsiron/CrimZen/issues). Ensure that you provide reproduction steps.
