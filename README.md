# CrimZen

A mixed color theme for Visual Studio Code. CrimZen uses a light design for the coding area with a darker style for all other regions. This design seeks to achieve a balance between the harshness of light themes and the low-contrast, washed-out bleakness of dark themes. This theme will likely look its best in rooms with high ambient lighting.
